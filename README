Dependencies:
A couple basic Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file for pip loading, need VLC player installed on your computer (not yet tested on Linux).

Usage:
Currently just paste in the MP3 file path into the 'main' function, will load the audio. Press space to play/pause, binded keys to mark each instrument.
Each time an instrument key is pressed, a time marker (in milliseconds) is added to the data structure, current time - 1 second.

Once the song finishes, close the pop-up window to have the data structure printed to screen (TODO: save to database instead).

Todo:

Add tracker of whether each instrument is currently playing, adding markers in the data structure for entrances and exits.
Currently data structure is just an array of each time the key is pressed. However, this may be easier to consume for net training.

I was planning on hooking this into MongoDB or similar, add button or feature to save the marked timestamps data structure to the database.
This database could then be consumed by the neural net training routine

Another nice to have would be the ability to run through a track multiple times, since if it's complicated it may be tough to get all markers the first time.
